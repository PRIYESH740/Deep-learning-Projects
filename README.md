# Deep Learning Project  
### 1.Handwritten digit detection using Artificial Neural network  
The Handwritten Digit Detection project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images, such as those in the MNIST dataset.
This project demonstrates how ANNs can effectively recognize and classify image data, showcasing their applications in computer vision tasks.  
  
### 2.Cats and Dogs Classification using Convolutional neural network  
The Cats and Dogs Classification project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. 
This project demonstrates the power of CNNs in image classification tasks, showcasing their ability to learn complex visual patterns.
